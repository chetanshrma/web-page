I am a trained sensory scientist, graduated from Kansas State University, USA. My research interests are interdisciplinary in nature, ranging from cereal science  to sensory science. I extensively use statistics to help improve the signal-to-noise ratio. My work benefits the local businesses to thrive and compete at a global level.
